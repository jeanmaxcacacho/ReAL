"""
This file contains the most basic scripts to implement
naive retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

1. Receiving and chunking external data from user
2. Connecting to HuggingFace and obtaining embeddings
3. Performing RAG task and generating quiz items

In further iterations of this project, I intend to
turn this into a proper backend with FastAPI.
